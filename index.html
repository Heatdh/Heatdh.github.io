      Hello! I'm <strong>Rayen Dhahri</strong>, a Machine Learning Research Engineer specializing in <strong>Neural Network Optimization</strong>, 
      <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>, and <strong>Efficient Learning</strong>. I have extensive experience optimizing and 
      deploying complex AI models on resource-constrained devices, with a proven track record in both research and industrial settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strong academic foundation from the <em>Technical University of Munich (TUM)</em> and my visiting opportunities at <em>EPFL</em> and ETH Zurich, I have had the 
      privilege of working with leading organizations such as <em>Intel</em>, <em>Huawei</em>, <em>CARIAD</em>, and <em>BMW</em>.
      I am currently working as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at the Corporate Research Team of <em>Zeiss</em>, doing what I love doing most (Applied Research).
      My work focuses on making neural networks more efficient through techniques like model sparsification, quantization, and knowledge distillation, 
      publishing impactful research at top conferences like <strong>NeurIPS</strong>.
