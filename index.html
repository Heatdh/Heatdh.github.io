      Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Rayen Dhahri</strong>, a Machine Learning Research Engineer with expertise in <strong>Efficient Learning</strong>, 
      <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, and <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>. I thrive on solving complex challenges in 
      AI and have extensive experience in both research and industrial projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strong academic foundation from the <em>Technical University of Munich (TUM)</em> and my visiting opportunities at <em>EPFL</em> and ETH Zurich, I have had the 
      privilege of working with leading organizations such as <em>Intel</em>, <em>Huawei</em>, <em>CARIAD</em>, and <em>BMW</em>.
      I am currently working as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at the Corporate Research Team of <em>Zeiss</em>, doing what I love doing most (Applied Research).
      My work spans deploying cutting-edge ML models on constrained devices, optimizing neural networks, and publishing impactful 
      research at top conferences like <strong>NeurIPS</strong>.
